Cross-platform 12Riven script editor, intended for use with the English translation

Massive credit to [12Riven Script Editor](https://github.com/Exormeter/12Riven_ScriptEditor) from Essometer and [chroipahtz's version](https://github.com/chroipahtz/12Riven_ScriptEditor), as this is a different implementation of the same things, and that's where much of the info and research for this originally happened
